## Edit Network
In this topic, we will discuss how to edit the networks.

### Edit Power Distribution Network (PDN)
You can edit PDN in `Network` page in V2Sim. The blue lines are roads while the black elements are PDN components. Click on them to view its property in the sidebar on right.

Properties showed in the sidebar may be edited by double click. Note that not all the properties are editable.

**Legend:**
+ Black lines are transmission lines.
+ Black circles are generators.
+ Black rectangles are buses.
+ Black squares are energy storage systems.
+ Black triangles are wind turbines or photovoltaic systems.

Currently, it is not able to add or remove PDN elements in the GUI. Please directly edit the PDN file to achieve this.

### Edit Transportation Network
Use SUMO NetEdit to edit your transportation network. Usually, the file is ended with `.net.xml` or `.net.xml.gz`.
